Provides the [Docs](../../guides/docs/docs-introduction.md) functionality and is the default docs plugin for Docusaurus.

## Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @docusaurus/plugin-content-docs
```

:::tip

If you have installed `@docusaurus/preset-classic`, you don't need to install it as a dependency. You can also configure it through the [classic preset options](presets.md#docusauruspreset-classic) instead of doing it like below.

## Configuration

## Markdown Frontmatter

Markdown documents can use the following markdown frontmmatter metadata fields, enclosed by a line `---` on either side:

- `id`: A unique document id. If this field is not present, the document's `id` will default to its file name (without the extension).
- `title`: The title of your document. If this field is not present, the document's `title` will default to its `id`.
- `hide_title`: Whether to hide the title at the top of the doc. By default it is `false`.
- `hide_table_of_contents`: Whether to hide the table of contents to the right. By default it is `false`.
- `sidebar_label`: The text shown in the document sidebar and in the next/previous button for this document. If this field is not present, the document's `sidebar_label` will default to its `title`.
- `custom_edit_url`: The URL for editing this document. If this field is not present, the document's edit URL will fall back to `editUrl` from options fields passed to `docusaurus-plugin-content-docs`.
- `keywords`: Keywords meta tag for the document page, for search engines.
- `description`: The description of your document, which will become the `<meta name="description" content="..."/>` and `<meta property="og:description" content="..."/>` in `<head>`, used by search engines. If this field is not present, it will default to the first line of the contents.
- `image`: Cover or thumbnail image that will be used when displaying the link to your post.
